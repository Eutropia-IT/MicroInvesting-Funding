# Short Brief Our Project
* Many people want to invest a very small amount of money and make a passive income from that. On the other hand there’s many new entrepreneur who has fabulous and money making ideas but can’t work on that because of fundings.
* Our project is to bring these two types of people together. The users will deposit their micro amounts, and the new entrepreneurs will submit their ideas for screening. Then an expert team will review the ideas and select ideas for fundings.
* Then the users will get a notification with details, if they become interested they’ll invest their deposited money on the idea.
* Here’s a note, the deposited money will be funded through the system(company) on partnership basis. And the profit will be divided to the users as per their investment.
* The system will keep a commission for their service.
